# Color Scheme generator

## Lessons Learned

After completing Scrimba's URLs & REST section of Module 9 - Working with APIs, we were presented with the challenge to build a color scheme generator, based on a figma design
, using the API from the https://www.thecolorapi.com/.

Throughout this section, we were taught how to use Javascript's fetch API in order to get data from an API and display or interact with it.

We also learned:

- HTTP Requests
  - URLs, endpoints
  - Methods
  - Body
  - Header
- REST APIs
  - Resources
  - Parameters
